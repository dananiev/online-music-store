            Edward Christopher Sheeran was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, England, on 17 February 1991. His early childhood home was on Birchcliffe Road in nearby Hebden Bridge. 
            His father was a curator at Cartwright Hall in Bradford and his mother worked at Manchester City Art Gallery. When Sheeran was still a child, he moved with his family from Hebden Bridge to Framlingham in Suffolk. 
            He has an older brother named Matthew, who works as a composer. Sheeran's parents, John and Imogen, are from London. His paternal grandparents are Irish, and Sheeran has stated that his father is from a "very large" Catholic family. 
            John is an art curator and lecturer, and Imogen is a culture publicist turned jewellery designer. His parents ran Sheeran Lock, an independent art consultancy, from 1990 to 2010.

            Sheeran sang at a local church choir at the age of four, learned how to play the guitar aged eleven, and began writing songs while at Thomas Mills High School in Framlingham.
            A 2004 school report described him as a "natural performer", and his classmates also voted him "most likely to be famous". He was accepted at the National Youth Theatre in London as a teenager.
            He successfully auditioned for Youth Music Theatre UK in 2007 and joined their production of Frankenstein in Plymouth. He is a patron of Youth Music Theatre UK and of Access to Music, where he studied Artist Development. 
            Sheeran is a second cousin of Northern Irish broadcaster Gordon Burns, who hosted the British game show The Krypton Factor.
